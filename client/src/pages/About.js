          Find a Classroom is the perfect solution for University at Buffalo
          students who are looking for an available classroom to study in. With
          just a few clicks, our site scans a database of UB classes utilizing
          up-to-date info on the location and scheduling of classrooms. Keep in
          mind that Find a Classroom does not include private events like office
          hours or club meetings. And, if someone else has already used the site
          to book a study spot, that classroom might not be available. But
          overall, Find a Classroom makes it super easy to find a great study
          spot!
