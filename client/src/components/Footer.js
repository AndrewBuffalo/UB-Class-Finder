        Find a Classroom is the perfect solution for University at Buffalo
        students who are looking for an available classroom to study in. With
        just a few clicks, this platform scans a database of UB classes and
        provides up-to-date info on the location and scheduling of classrooms.
        But, keep in mind that it doesn't include private events like office
        hours or club meetings. And, if someone else has already used the site
        to book a study spot, that classroom might not be available. But
        overall, Find a Classroom makes it super easy to find a great study
        spot!
